#Multiple Linear Regression


# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('50_Startups.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values  # this is the matrix of in-dependent variables
y = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values  # this is the dependant variable

# Encoding categorical data
# Encoding the Independent Variable
# The encoding must be done before the splitting
# This section will actually encode our "State" column into number like data since it's a string (dummy variables)
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
labelencoder_X = LabelEncoder()
X[:, 3] = labelencoder_X.fit_transform(X[:, 3])
onehotencoder = OneHotEncoder(categorical_features = [3])
X = onehotencoder.fit_transform(X).toarray()

# Avoiding the Dummy Variable Trap
X = X[:, 1:]  # removed the 1st column from x , by putting 1 we starting from index 1 till the end

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 1/3, random_state = 0)

X_test = sc_X.transform(X_test)
